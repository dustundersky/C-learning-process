1.what is variable
In my opinion,the way we define a variable isjust name a specific space in storage,and then we can put specific data in.Yes, two factor.

type name;
such as 
int i;
float j;//提一下内存的释放？

2.operation
2.1 assignment =
equal-sign here is not what we thought at math,it means assignment,the function means that we put a thing(value) in to a box(storage)


expression as below:
int i;
int i=1;//we should initialize the value as first in case some bugs occur.
int i=1,j=2;//we have to define all variabiesat the first of the program in C.it related to complier,like C89,C99.


3. local and global


4.name rule 
make the name meaningful as possible.do not always one letter.
